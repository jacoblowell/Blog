      <description>I am using data from the nflscrapR package to investigate offensive success on goal to go situations on different downs. I will perform exploratory data analysis and modeling on regular season game data from 2009-2018, and test the performance on 2019 regular season data.
Section 1. Initial Analysis Figure 1. If we define success as a play with a positive value for excepted points added (epa), we can see a nice split in good/bad distribution for 3rd and 4th down.</description>
