##  breakout by each down




first_and_goal <-  pbp_all_rp %>%  filter(down == 1 & goal_to_go ==1 ) #%>% count(touchdown)

second_and_goal <-  pbp_all_rp %>%  filter(down == 2 & goal_to_go ==1 )

third_and_goal <-  pbp_all_rp %>%  filter(down == 3 & goal_to_go ==1 )

fourth_and_goal  <-   pbp_all_rp %>%  filter(down == 4 & goal_to_go ==1 )
```


I am using data from the [nflscrapR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00998) package to investigate offensive success on goal to go situations on different downs.

## Figure 1.

```{r}

four_downs <-  pbp_all_rp    %>%   filter(down >0 & goal_to_go == 1) %>% ggplot(aes( x = epa ,y = td_prob,     color = TD_Scored )) + geom_point(aes(text = play_desc)) + theme_tq() + 
  labs(    title = glue("Expected points added by Touchdown Probability"             )  ,
       x = "Expected Points Added" , y = "Touchdown Probability" ,  color = "" ) + scale_color_tq() +
scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)  + facet_grid(~down  , scales = "free")

ggplotly(four_downs)
```


## Figure 2.

```{r}



pbp_all_rp   %>%   filter(down >0 & goal_to_go == 1) %>% ggplot(aes( x =epa ,     fill = TD_Scored )) + geom_histogram() + theme_tq() + 
  labs(title = glue("Separation between successful and unsuccessful plays becomes more pronounced at later downs"             )  ,
       x = "Expected Points Added" , y = "Plays"  ,  fill = "") + scale_color_tq() +
scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)  + facet_grid(~down  )


```



## Table 1. 


```{r}
pbp_all_rp   %>%   filter(down >0 & goal_to_go == 1) %>% group_by(down) %>% summarise(Average_EPA = mean(epa)   , Median_EPA = median(epa)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2 , caption = "Goal to go - Average and median Expected points added by down")
```


If we define sucess as a play with a positive value for excepted points added (epa), we can see 

## Table 2.


###  What is sucess rate and TD Rate from each downn  ?

```{r}
pbp_all_rp %>%  filter(goal_to_go ==1) %>%  count(down, touchdown  ) %>%  group_by( down) %>% mutate(`Touchdown Rate` = n / sum(n)) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  #filter(touchdown ==1) %>%  
  knitr::kable()


pbp_all_rp %>%  filter(goal_to_go ==1) %>%  count(down, success  ) %>%  group_by( down) %>% mutate( `Success Rate`= n / sum(n)) %>% ungroup() %>%
 # filter(success ==1) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```

  labs(    title = glue("No Play -- Expected points added by Touchdown Probability"             )  ,
