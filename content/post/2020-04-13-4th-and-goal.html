<p>I am using data from the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00998">nflscrapR</a> package to investigate offensive success on goal to go situations on different downs. I will perform exploratory data analysis and modeling on regular season game data from 2009-2018, and test the performance on 2019 regular season data.</p>

<p>If we define success as a play with a positive value for excepted points added (epa), we can see a nice split in good/bad distribution for 3rd and 4th down. There is a decent split for second down as well.</p>

<p>We can hover over plays in <strong>Figure 2.</strong> to see from the description of plays with penalties that penalties contribute to expected points added. This means that a “no_play” with a penalty can be a positive or negative outcome, so I will include these plays in my “Success” models. Since none of these plays result in a touchdown for the offence, I will exclude them from my touchdown and yardage modeling.</p>
