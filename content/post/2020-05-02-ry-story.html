<p>She hurled many accusations at me along with my belongings, a wintry mix of
stationery and slander. But nobody’s perfect as they say, and on the night she threw me
out, Meredith made one point that I’ll concede. I really am a vindictive little fuck muffin.
At the time I’d denied it vehemently, but in spite of how loud and angry my voice
got, I couldn’t fool her, let alone myself. Later, as I dumped all of my worldly
possessions out of a garbage bag and onto the twin sized bed in the motel room I’d
purchased for the night, I had flashbacks of each item being chucked at me. Each of my
prized fountain pens: black, red, and blue. My calfskin journal, a gift from Grand Ma Ma
on my ninth birthday. And last (and most lethal), a hardbound edition of my most recent
masterpiece, Mindless Mike Moves On. At a whopping eight hundred and sixty two
pages of melancholic brilliance, it had every right to hurt the most. And while it had in
fact left a sizable welt where its binding had slapped my forehead, that wound was
anesthetized by the greater pain my wife’s words had caused me.
Vindictive little fuck muffin. That’s what she said. She told me I had just spurned
the only person who’d ever believed in me. I’d raised my upper lip to commence a
protest then thought better of it. While any implication that she had ever believed in me
was completely absurd, the wording she’d chosen had been just vague enough to prove
more or less correct.
I didn’t always hate Michael. In fact, as the “Serialized Scranton Saga”
suggested, for many years I found his charming ignorance inspiring. But a man has his
limits, and after seven years of hearing people give Mike credit for my life’s work, I had
reached mine.
My jealousy didn’t just flick on overnight like a light switch. Its spread was more
viral, starting small and slow, then growing exponentially, infecting anything I’d ever
admired about the man and leaving it to choke out on its own blood. But all that
nastiness comes closer to the end, and this is only the beginning. The beginning of a
story that while it sounds less believable than any page of fiction I’ve ever written, is in
fact completely true. But true to my fiction, it’s a love story. A story of the one that made
me feel loved and appreciated in a way that Sam, and Michael, and Meredith never
could. A story of the one that made my heart grow like a black hole. A story of how I
found Dorian.
Of course, before Dorian, there was Sam. It would be painting with far too broad
a brush to label a woman as special as her an inciting incident. She was so many other
“ins” to me. Intelligent. Independent. Inspirational. Intoxicating. Enough to make a man
insane. But perhaps the most important “in” she gave me was an in at her company, at
a time when I needed work most. Even at the time I knew it was a bad idea, and I can’t
tell you whether I took the job in spite of the way she made me feel or because of it. But
regardless of the reasoning, the result was the same. In my defense, Samantha Otto
was the only one with the courage and empathy to extend a helping hand after the
incident. At that point, the only feeling I knew was that of being kicked when I was down,
and that was only from the passersby who went so far as to acknowledge my woeful
existence at all. So she reached out her hand and I took it. In spite of my unrequited
love for her? Because of it? Hell, what difference does it make now?
“The pay is shit, Ricky, and the work will be thankless. Well, apart from my
thanks of course.” Sam punctuated the sentence with a wink of an emerald eye. “But if
you do say yes, you could help build something truly great.”
“Well when you put it that way, I can’t think of anyone more qualified,” I said. I
attempted a wink of my own, but fear it looked less like flirtation and more like a reaction
to lemon juice.
“Great! Not to mention, if we can get Google to commit, your stock options will go
through the roof.”
As she showed me to my cubicle, Sam smiled with a warm authenticity that I
could hardly believe. How could she be so calm after all I had put her through in the
past? All of the Post-it notes I’d left on her desk, oozing with innuendo. The brazen
advances in front of her eternal fiance Ray. That night she left me tongue tied on the
booze cruise. How was this not more awkward?
“So, this is your command center.” She pulled out my chair and powered on my
desktop monitor. An “Otto Correct” logo in the center of the screen awoke to greet me.
“Kinda brings you back, doesn’t it?”
I looked her in the eyes and inhaled deeply, sucking in her scent. “Yeah, kinda.”
The way she’d explained it to me earlier, her startup was an autocorrect software
company in beta. Sure, autocorrect already existed, but hers was supposed to be faster
with a more human intuition. I’d figure out exactly why that was in short order.
My primative understanding of beta meant a limited number of people got to test
the software for bugs. As it turned out in Sam’s case, beta meant a limited number of
people hacked into Google’s cloud to edit users’ spelling and grammar mistakes in real
time. She admitted that hiring grammarians to pose as programming while she fixed the
bugs in her algorithm was far from ideal, but was adamant that landing the Google
contract would be worth a temporary dip of our toes into illegal waters. And who was I to
argue? With nonexistent book sales, no job prospects, and a burning desire to avoid a
return to The Office at all costs, I couldn’t deny a job. And I couldn’t deny Sam anything.
After filling me in, she pointed to a framed quote poster on the wall that said “Well
behaved women seldom make history.” We shared a laugh at that. When it came to
Sam, I’d share any laugh I could get, even if the joke more or less boiled down to “we
might both go to prison for a very long time.”
At that moment the computer made the sound of a bell ringing, and a blank
Google document opened on my screen. Words began to appear without any
depression of the laptop keys. Sam looked at the sophisticated Ouija, grinned, and told
me she’d “leave me to it.”
deer mister smedal I am writing this cuz IM sorry fore doin waht I did too you inn
study hall. I still think farts r funny but shouldnot ov done it inn yer face. i hope youu can
forgive me cuz if not they said im suspeneed and so im riting this leter
sorry and i wont fart on you again- jeff
I fought every urge in me to erase the whole letter and write “crack a fucking
book, you simpleton!” But it was the first assignment on my first day, so I decided to
behave.
Dear Mister Smedal,
I am writing this because I’m sorry for doing what I did to you in study hall. I still
think farts are funny, but shouldn’t have done it in your face. I hope you can forgive me
because if not, they said I’m suspended, and so I’m writing this letter.
I’m sorry, and I won’t fart on you again,
Jeff
I looked back over it. Shakespeare it was not, but I had caught more than a robot
would have, and perhaps Jeff would be free to flatulate another day. I commended
myself on a job well done and glanced at my watch to see how much time had elapsed.
A small part of me died when I realized it had only been three minutes and twenty six
seconds. The digital bell rang again. Another possessed document appeared and
began writing. I indulged myself with a brief glance across the room to where Sam was
standing, turned back to the screen, cracked my knuckles, and dug in.
I’ll admit that 11 am seemed early for lunch, but when Sam tapped a French
tipped fingernail on my shoulder and said there was pizza in the breakroom, I felt it
proof of a merciful, loving God. After three hours of fixing comma splices and changing
there to their, Sam’s smile made me feel like a scientist using an eyewash station to
dispel caustic chemicals.
“Now Ricky, I’ve got a surprise for you. Some of the old team is here helping me
out.” Sam gestured at three familiar faces hovering around the breakroom table. She
reintroduced them to me by name, as I reminisced on how I’d described them in triple S.
“You remember Oskar…”
Know it all in the office, ballerina in the bedroom
“…and Angel…”
Cat worshipping Jesus freak
“…and Gavin.”
Has the brain and body of a prize winning hog
I forced the corners of my lips upward.
“Of course. How could I forget?”
“So,” Gavin slobbered in between open mouthed chomps of pizza, “How ya like
working here so far?”
Before I could answer, Sam jolted to attention. She grabbed a stack of
documents from a photocopier in the corner and placed one in front of each of us. Then
she grabbed four click pens from her shirt pocket and placed one atop a blank line at
the bottom of each of our papers.
“Thanks for reminding me, Gavin. I need you to sign your NDAs.”
“NBA?” Gavin asked. “I like basketball.”
“Actually,” Oskar cut in. “It stands for Non Disclosure Agreement. So we don’t
talk about what we read in all of those private documents.”
“Exactly!” Sam rewarded Oskar’s correct answer with a hug he didn’t deserve or
appreciate. “We can’t talk about any content. It’s important to respect everyone’s
privacy. We’re just in it for the love of good grammar, folks.”
Sure, that and a slice of Google’s billions. But I had no reservations when it came
to signing. Sam was the only one there I wanted to talk to anyway, and I felt an implied
intimacy between us, knowing that I would be keeping her secrets. I wrote my name in
cursive, an arrow pierced heart in place of the dot above the i in Ricky. She blushed
when I handed it to her, leaving me to ponder whether her embarrassment was from
flattery or fright. She collected herself and the other forms quickly, offering a
professional “thanks” to all of us before leaving the room. We each grabbed a slice of
pizza, Gavin his third, and chewed in awkward silence for several bites.
“So,” It was Oskar who broke the quiet. “Did you guys see The Office last night?”
“Aww, that show is freaking awesome,” Gavin said, giggling.
“I don’t watch that perverted trash,” Angel said, rolling her eyes. “It doesn’t teach
good values.”
“Well last night, Jim and Pam had their baby Christened,” Oskar tried. His voice
raised as if he were asking a question.
“Yeah, they had a baby,” Gavin said, spitting flecks of crust onto the carpet as he
did so. “Because they totally banged.”
“Ugh, see what I mean?” Angel shook her head and scoffed. “It’s filth. It’s not
right.”
“I agree.” I said. The three of them looked at me, confused. “It’s not right.
Canonically speaking, I mean. In the books, Jim and Pam never got together.”
“Books?” Gavin looked horrified at the thought of the written medium. “What are
you talking about?”
“The Office has books?” Angel asked, forgetting to pretend she wasn’t interested
in “that filth.”
“Sure does,” I said. “And I write them. Although technically, The Office is just the
name of the first one. The proper name of the series is ‘Serialized Scranton Saga,’ or
triple S as I like to call it.”
“Nuh uh.” Gavin looked incredulous in a way unique to dullards of his ilk, the kind
who will never actually know what the word incredulous means.
“Actually,” Oskar said, “Back in Austria, one of my professors told me there was a
rumor going around that The Office was an adaptation, and that the original idea came
from a guy named Ricky. But I always just thought it was an urban legend. A myth.”
“I’m no myth,” I said, my pride swelling. “And neither are those books. I slave
over them, night and day. I’ve put years of my life into triple S. My last book was eight
hundred and sixty two pages. You know how hard it is to get it that long?”
“That’s what she said,” Gavin said, erupting with laughter. Oskar and Angel
joined in, albeit begrudgingly in Angel’s case.
I bit down on my lower lip hard enough to cause a bloodrush that inflated my
forehead like a balloon. That’s what she said. That’s what Michael said. I cringed at the
thought of the buffoon who had stolen my story and in turn my spotlight.
“Michael doesn’t say that in the books,” I said, calmly as I could through gritted
teeth. It fell on deaf ears. Gavin was still shaking with laughter, and Oskar had drifted
off.
“Huh. In my mind I’d always pictured Ricky as British,” Oskar said, to himself as
much as anybody.
That afternoon, after properly formatting a particularly odorous Film Lit 303 essay
exploring foot fetishism in the work of Tarantino, a digital steam whistle sounded on my
monitor, signifying the end of my first work day. The sound was accompanied by an
animated whistle puffing smoke, one of Sam’s cute creations. I glimpsed her standing
idly by the door and got up, feeling invigorated to make a productive day even better.
Sure, maybe it would be a tad reckless to ask my boss out on the first day, not to
mention she was engaged and I was married. But if the laugh we’d shared over her
quote poster was any indication, she was someone who could appreciate the saying
“fortune favors the bold.”
I made my way through the mostly empty cubicle farm’s labyrinthine layout. It
was certainly too big for Otto Correct’s current staff, but if the company grew like a
goiter, as Sam expected it would, the space would be filled soon enough. I heard
laughter as I turned the last cubicle corner. Sam’s sweet chuckles were in the mix, but
contaminated with Gavin’s guffaws. In fact, all three of my former office-mates stood
between me and Sam. They had crowded around her, laughing at a video on her
phone. I couldn’t see the screen from my current distance, but I heard a cat hissing
followed by a hearty Bronx cheer. Then only laughter.
“The C-c-cat, f- f-far-ted! Gavin said in between convulsions. He had worked
himself into tears.
Even Angel was grinning. “He’s such a cutie,” she said, cooing softly.
“Let me see.” I felt I must have been missing something. I couldn’t see how the
litterbox act Gavin had described was enough to make the only woman I’d ever truly
loved double over in hysterics. They replayed the video, and I’m sorry to say that I
hadn’t missed a thing. Somehow, watching the exact same idiotic clip had left my
colleagues laughing even harder. I felt like an outsider. Any hopes I’d had of asking
Sam to accompany me for a drink had slipped out like that foul feline’s methane.
“Here, I’ve got an even better one!” She pulled up another video, this one even
more disgusting than the last. It was called “That’s What She Said Compilation,”
starring, as I’m sure you’ve already guessed, Michael. Cheap suit wearing, no brain
having, credit stealing Michael.
“That’s what she said!” He said. Gavin had elevated from weeping to wetting
himself. Sam wrapped a shoulder around Oskar as if she was laughing so hard she
might collapse.
“That’s what she said!” He said. I should have felt pride, seeing my creation bring
so much entertainment to those around me.
“That’s what she said!” He said. But instead I felt the grief of a parent tuning into
the evening news, learning from the top story that my son is a serial killer.
“Enough already!” I snatched the phone from Sam’s hands and paused the
video. I was able to collect myself in time to refrain from spiking the phone into the trash
can. I ran through a quick breathing exercise I’d learned in anger management after the
incident, then handed it back begrudgingly. “Can’t you find something funnier than this?”
“Not likely, Ricky.” Oskar said. “Unless you’ve got any good fail videos.”
“Fail videos?” I asked.
“It’s 2010, man!” Oskar said, shaking his head. “Get with the program!”
“Fail videos. You know, like people slipping and falling,” Sam said.
“Or getting hit in the balls,” Gavin added.
“And you,” I looked at Sam directly. “You think that’s funny? Funnier than
Michael?”
“Yeah, sure,” Sam said. “Fail videos are the best.”
“Thanks, that’s helpful,” I said, and walked out. By the time I had closed the door,
the video was playing again. On the other side of the door, fresh laughter was knocking.
No matter the job, it had always been common for the daydreams of my evening
commute to follow me inside when I got home. To that point, I’d always thought it a
harmless distraction from how unhappy Meredith made me, but that night I must have
been lost in my head even more than normal. I neglected to watch my footing as I
plodded up the steep wooden staircase to our second floor apartment, slipping and
nearly breaking my neck when my foot landed awkwardly on the creaky top step. It had
needed maintenance for years, which is something that could be said about the
marriage awaiting me inside. But both were so rotten to begin with that I feared
intervention of any kind would only make them break irreparably. I left the rotten step
and greeted my rotten wife with an uninspired wave of three fingers. Her form of
greeting was to laugh hysterically with the person on the other end of her phone call, but
I couldn’t really blame her. Whoever she was talking to could actually make her happy.
“Sorry,” she said when she finally hung up. “How are you?” I knew she didn’t
actually care, so I suspected it was a tactic to change the subject.
“Fine,” I said. Then, after a strategic pause: “Who was that?”
“No one,” she said, breaking eye contact. “Just… Michael.”
For someone I made a point to avoid at all costs, the man sure had a way of
following me everywhere.
“That fool? What the hell did he want?”
“What do you think?” She said, emboldening herself to meet my gaze again.
“They’re about to shoot again. The second half of season seven. He wants the rights to
your… little book.”
“It’s not little!” I snapped for a moment, then remembered my breathing
exercises. After two deep inhales and two long exhales, I proceeded with calm and cool.
“It’s eight hundred and sixty two pages. And I’m not letting that dunce touch my
masterpiece. Not this time. I’m done making him look good.”
“We could use the money.” She poured a jar of discount pasta sauce into a little
pot and a box of discount spaghetti into a big one to punctuate her point. “You’re so
damned stubborn.”
“And you’re so damned forgetful. I have a job now, remember?”
“Oh, right.” The sarcasm that dripped from her words was far thicker than the
pasta sauce. “So tell me, how is Pam?”
“You know that’s not her name,” I said.
“Ahh, yes, because you changed it like you do for all of your characters. Except
for your beloved wife, who gets to share names with your dumb, drunk whore
character!”
I sighed and shook my head.
“How many times must we go over this? It’s a fluke, Meredith. Sheer
coincidence! And for your information, if you actually took the time to read Mindless
Mike, you’d know Michael wouldn’t be any too interested in it.”
“What do you mean?” She looked concerned, finally starting to understand that
my writing directly impacted her beloved Michael.
“I mean he’s out. Shitcanned. Or since all you do is watch network television, let
me put it into terms you’ll understand. I told Michael ‘yuh fired!’” Though it was primarily
meant to anger my wife, I was quietly pleased with my faithful impression of the boss
from The Apprentice, as I admired the man and his savvy leadership.
“No, that won’t do.” She looked at me in horror as if I’d just told her she had
terminal cancer. “That won’t do at all.”
“It already did, toots.” At that point I was gloating. “The book is published.
Michael got the sack.” I grabbed a copy of Mindless Mike from a nearby cookbook shelf,
and opened to page 624. “Here, I can read it for you if you don’t believe me.”
“No!” She acted as if hearing words I’d written would make her melt like the
Wicked Witch of the West. I glanced at the boiling pasta water on the stove in front of
her, and for a moment I wondered if there could be something to it.
Before I took any action, Meredith lifted the big pot off the stove and started
straining the pasta through a colander. She divided it into two bowls and poured a glob
of sauce on top of each. She handed me a bowl and a scowl, then scowled at the dining
room table, then back at me. “Are we really going to keep doing this?” Her eyes asked
me.
“I should probably take this to the office,” I said. “Robert’s Rule awaits.”
She looked at me as if I had started speaking in English, then switched to
Russian mid sentence.
“You know, Robert California? The new boss? Book eight of triple S?”
“Oh yeah?” It was the first time she’d smiled since her chat with Michael. “I
thought you hadn’t started it yet.”
She knew I hadn’t started it yet. It was a wound she’d prodded at with such
regularity that it hadn’t ever had time to scab over. I began planning my vicious rebuttal,
but before I could vocalize it, she grabbed her bowl and made for our bedroom. Who
was I kidding? Her bedroom. I hadn’t set foot in there in months. The bedroom door
creaked as she pulled it shut. Something about seeing her face as I heard that noise
made me think of the rotten top step, and how easy it would be for someone to fall from
it.
If nothing else, a work and marriage tandem provided me the comfort of routine.
Ever the creature of habit, I came to appreciate the familiarity of driving home from
work, squabbling with Meredith, then grabbing my half of whatever gruel she’d prepared
that night and getting as far away from her as the walls of our tiny apartment would
allow. Like clockwork, I would choke down as much food as I could bear while firing up
my laptop in the office, and opening the word document for whatever part of triple S I
happened to be working on. When the word doc was ready, I’d slide the rest of my
dinner across my desk to remain uneaten (at least until the raccoons got into it on trash
night) and begin writing.
After the incident, I had imagined the extra time that unemployment afforded me
would mean my writing would be more prolific than ever. But without the structure and
urgency of a schedule, I’d floundered, managing to put the final touches on the last draft
of Mindless Mike, but failing to create anything new. The incident had been seven
months ago, but my new job gave me new hope that I could break my silent slump. I
was optimistic that spending my days with Sam would inspire a creative future, but that
night it had me looking to the past instead.
It had all been leading up to this. Months of simmering sexual tension and awkward flirting, months of being
her buddy to joke with and shoulder to cry on, months of learning everything about her, like her passion for painting and
proclivity for mixed berry yogurt. All of it led to this moment. Where I was leaning over her desk, my hands crossing the
stationery cluttered threshold, and she was leaning right back. Looking me in the eyes, almost close enough to kiss. I
knew this was the chance I had been waiting for.
“Do you like, uh… going out at the end of the week for a drink?” I asked her, my voice betraying the knowledge
that I was fast approaching a point of no return.
“Yeah,” she said, the nervousness in her voice palpable.
“Well that’s why we’re all going out. So that we can have an end of the week drink.”
“So when are we going out?” Pam caressed the bottom of her chin with her fingers as she spoke.
“I dunno, tonight?” I tried to play it off as if it was no big deal, but my insides were on fire.
“Okay, yeah.” For a glorious fraction of a second I felt euphoria, but was quickly interrupted by an unwelcome
guest barging through the door to my right. It was Roy from the warehouse. Roy, Pam’s fiance.
“Hey, man.” Though we had no relationship, he spoke to me first. It could have been random chance, but I
doubt it. He struck me as the kind of guy who made a habit of talking to the man in the room first.
“What’s going on?” I went for friendly, but couldn’t entirely hide my disappointment. If he noticed, he didn’t
seem to care.
“Hi, baby.”
“Hey.” Pam said. “Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?”
Now he was the one breaking the threshold, and I had retreated backward.
“Uh, no, no. Come on, let’s get out of here. Go home.”
I looked down at my wrist, figuring it would be best to pretend to check my watch, but I was too distracted to
pick the correct arm. No matter. Who cared what time it was, if I wouldn’t be spending my time with Pam?
No, that afternoon hadn’t been the first time when an opportunity to take Sam out
had slipped through my fingers. I’d hoped time would dull the pain, but if anything,
reading that excerpt from my first book had intensified it. I had told myself Otto Correct
would be a fresh start, but my dismal history was threatening to repeat itself. Always the
platonic work buddy while Ray got to take her home. Always getting upstaged by
Michael. Always promising myself to protect my latest work, then pimping it out to
Hollywood when the rent check came due.
Well not this time. I’d had enough. Let them see how funny Michael was when he
didn’t have my lines to read. Of course that would take months to play out, and would
only address half of my problems. I’d still need to find a way to best Ray and unlock
Sam’s heart. I thought back to our conversation on my way out the door and wondered
if just maybe, she’d slipped me a map to the key.
A Google search of “How To Make Fail Videos” was short on “How To,” but made
up for it in videos themselves. Countless hours of dogs running headlong into trees
while chasing frisbees, skateboarders whacking scrotums on metal guardrails, yogis
leaving shartstains on white pants during tree pose. But if bulk of product was any
indicator, the public seemed to have an affinity for watching people slip and fall above
all else. Soccer players getting slide tackled and bashing heads on goalposts, pogo
stick enthusiasts breaking tailbones on blundered backflips, fatsos shattering
photocopiers while duplicating bare asscheeks. And the views they had accrued
numbered in the millions. What a world.
And how did they get made? Filming yourself at all times seemed like the key
element, with being a reckless moron placing in close second. I had an aversion to the
former and was too brilliant for the latter, so it seemed I’d have to improvise. But my
lunch break with Gavin served as a heartening reminder that imbeciles were
everywhere, so I’d just need to find the right camera.
I typed “Best Fail Video Camera” into the Google search, but again came in light
on anything other than videos themselves. At that moment, I wished there was a human
in some cubicle invading my privacy to give me the exact information I wanted. It made
me smile, knowing that my new job was filling a public need. I was truly doing God’s
work.
My searches of Amazon, Wal-Mart, and Best Buy were fruitless. Their cameras
were sleek and slick, boasting high definition and professional production value. I
needed something more homespun and gritty. I had faint memories of hearing about a
site where people could buy and sell goods from each other without lining a middle
man’s pockets, but what was it called? I knew it was named after a man. A man’s name
that started with a C, I believe. Chad? Chris? Craig? After a couple more searches, I
found a site that looked promising. As it turned out, it was called Creed’s List. I clicked
the link, pleased with my correct hunch about the C name.
An antivirus notification popped up on my screen warning me that the site I was
about to visit was potentially part of “the dark web.” I knew little about the internet, and
nothing of this “dark web,” but dark was my preference in coffee, chocolate, and
comedy, so how bad could it really be?
The site had a wealth of message boards, including categories like jobs,
housing, services, and for sale. Under services, I glimpsed a category called
hitman. I had to give it to this Creed fellow, he certainly had a healthy sense of humor.
I checked out the for sale section and clicked on photo + video. I was frustrated
by the off topic nature of the first post, which wasn’t selling a product at all, but instead
the services of a snuff film director. The second post was puzzling in that it offered a roll
of 8mm film that was “less than 18 years old.” With brand new film available at
the big box stores, I didn’t see what the fuss was all about. But the seller must have
thought that age designation was important, having mentioned it three times in the
paragraph long writeup.
Any discouragement that was building in me diffused when the headline for the
third post caught my eye.
“Gray Dorian Camcorder (Killer Picture!)”
Shoot videos with ageless beauty on this one of a kind Dorian
camcorder. This gray video camera captures souls like no other.
This little beauty will make your deepest, darkest desires a
reality.
It’s a deal for your life.
It was oddly written. Overly flowery to begin with, then ending with a poor
translation. “A deal of a lifetime,” it should have said. No matter. I had seen far worse at
work, and I wasn’t about to let a foreigner’s lack of command over the English language
stop me from picking out the perfect tool for the job of winning over Sam. I looked for
contact info to inquire about price, or the logistics of where to go to pick it up, but the
only thing I found was a big red button at the bottom that said I Accept.
I clicked on it, assuming more details would follow, but my browser closed and
that was that. I tried searching for Creed’s List again, but couldn’t find it, and there was
no record of it in my browser history. In any event, it was past midnight on a work day,
and I had to get some sleep if I was going to be sharp for Sam. I could figure out the
camera conundrum another time.
I set my alarm early to sneak out before Meredith started stirring. On my way out
I stared at the Keurig, yearning to supplement the four hours of air mattress slumber I’d
cobbled together with caffeine. But she was a light sleeper, and I couldn’t risk the noise
it would take to heat it. I grabbed my jacket and approached the stairway, making a
point to skip over the treacherous top step, then began my morning descent.
When I got to the bottom of the stairs, I spotted a brown cardboard box on the
stoop outside. It was no surprise that a package obstructed my path. Meredith had once
told me that for her, online shopping was therapeutic. Neither of us were brave enough
to attend actual therapy, so she compensated by getting hers delivered in little parcels.
Her spending had gotten worse as of late, but even the slightest grumble from me
earned a reminder that it was her money being spent, unless of course I’d finally come
to my senses and sold book seven.
This particular box looked tampered with, its half-tucked flaps assembled
haphazardly. But a closer look revealed that there had never been any shipping tape
with which to tamper. I picked the box up and opened its flaps, half expecting I’d find the
fecal matter of my neighbor’s teenage son. Instead, I found a camcorder.
It reminded me of the one my father had used to film my childhood birthday
parties in the 80s, except this one was gray instead of the traditional black. The only
other difference was that the brand name inscribed on the side foldout screen was one
I’d never heard of. It said Dorian in bright red letters, as advertised.
The chance of clomping back up the staircase without inciting an interaction with
Meredith was unlikely, so leaving the camera at home was out of the question. But it
was meant to be portable, and I wasn’t lugging lunch or a laptop, so I placed it into the
passenger seat of my sedan, buckled it in with the seatbelt for protection, and began my
drive.
My commute to Otto Correct HQ was only 11 minutes in the early morning, but in
that time I found that I’d grown quite attached to Dorian. When I pulled to a stop in the
parking lot, I hesitated. I thought of Dorian, locked up and lonely in the sedan while I
worked, and tucked him between my chest and the crook in my arm. I would have felt
embarrassed explaining it to someone, but I didn’t need to say a word; Dorian was small
enough to lay undetected beneath my jacket, which was now blanketed over my arm.
I didn’t see Sam on the walk to my cubicle, but I didn’t mind. I placed Dorian
down on the desk in front of me and felt happier than I had in the longest time. I had a
steady job with minimal stress and interruption, a reason to see Sam every day, and the
workday itself had a logical rhythm to it that I could appreciate, right down to our group
lunches at 11. Sam had said that if she were going to ask us to partake in such morally
murky work, we all needed to trust each other like family. And to her, part of family
meant family style cooking. The pizza she brought yesterday was her family offering.
Today Gavin was bringing chili, and tomorrow was my day. I had set my designs on
seafood bisque, for I’d heard Ray, with his violent shellfish allergy, was planning to drop
by.
I knew I should hack into Google and start my corrections, but my thoughts
wafted to Gavin and his big vat of chili. I stood up, grabbed Dorian, and made for the
break room. I followed a persistent voice inside of me, though I was unsure as to
whether or not it was my own.
When I got to the break room, Gavin was swaying recklessly, laboring to keep
the massive, steaming hot pot away from his gut. It didn’t help matters that his grip was
weakened by the pair of potholders on his hands. He was drenched in sweat as he
staggered backward toward the breakroom table, unaware that the vat’s lid lay on the
floor a pace and a half behind his left leg.
I knew I should call out to warn him, and told myself as much. But instead I found
myself lifting Dorian, flipping the side screen open, and pressing record. Gavin’s grunts
gave way to a loud clanging of metal, and then-
“Ahhh, my balls!”
It had happened in an instant. He had tripped on the lid, dropped the massive
vat, drowned the carpet in chili, slipped in the mess of his own making, fallen forward,
and landed on the scalding hot handle jutting out from the side of the vat. Balls first, of
course.
I saw Sam rushing in to help, but I was frozen in place. In the chaos, a stranger
spoke in a voice that sounded oddly like my own.
“Caught you slipping.”
Sam glared at me, then shouted.
“Ricky, call 911! He needs an ambulance!”
“Oh. Right.” My trance had been broken. I stopped recording, put Dorian down on
the breakroom table, and called for help.
When the EMTs left, my coworkers left with them. I told Sam not to worry. I would
stay and hold down the fort. I thought she would be more appreciative, but I didn’t make
a big deal of it, deciding that she’d find attractive in hindsight how I hadn’t made this
about me.
The rest of the day was quiet and productive. Dorian and I had the place to
ourselves. The time passed much faster in Dorian’s company, and somehow my work
felt more fulfilling. When it came to be lunchtime, I considered just working through it.
After all, I hadn’t brought lunch, and even though Meredith fed me like a malnourished
dog every night, I wasn’t about to lick chili out of the carpet in the light of day. I
contemplated calling the hospital to see how Gavin was getting on, but then I
remembered I had something better than a phone call. I had a video.
Dorian must have been more modern than he looked, for a USB cable tucked
into his side panel made for easy uploading onto my desktop. As I watched, rewound,
paused, and rewatched the video over and over, I told myself it was to deduce the
extent of Gavin’s injuries. But somewhere along the line, I realized that I was beginning
to acquire a taste for fail videos. And then there was that punchline at the end, “caught
you slipping.” It was brilliant. Far better than “that’s what she said.” I’d be doing the
public a disservice not to share it. I created a channel on YouTube called “CYS,” and
though I had no reason to believe there would ever be another, titled it “Caught You
Slipping - Vol. 1.”
That night when I got home, I made sure to take extra care on the staircase. I
swaddled Dorian in my jacket and watched each deliberate step I took. When I got to
the top, I held Dorian extra tight, but something in his closeness assured me that
everything was alright. That I should take him out of the jacket. I lifted him up and pulled
out the side screen so I could see the world as he did. The step that had once looked
dead and rotten looked anything but through Dorian. I felt compelled to press record
right then and there, but the voice from earlier came back, even stronger and clearer
than before. “Not yet, Ricky,” it said. “Not quite yet.”
Inside, I found Meredith pulling the tab on a can of Spam, as if it were a ripcord
and the jellied swine a parachute that could save our coupledom from plummeting to its
demise. I kept walking toward her and the burners she stood over. Confused, she
leaned toward me, surrendering herself for a hug. But I wasn’t about to waste my
precious arms by wrapping them around her. I shooed her aside with one hand and kept
Dorian secured in the other.
I eased Dorian down onto the counter top, placing three loaves of Wonder Bread
around him for safety. Next, I lifted the pan of sizzling Spam from its burner, and
dropped it directly into the kitchen sink.
“What the hell? Meredith lunged toward me, slapping my cheek hard enough to
change its coloring. “I’m cooking us dinner, asshole!”
“Not tonight, Meredith. I lack the time or the patience to pretend there’s a real
chance of us eating together, or that anything you’d make would qualify as dinner. It’s
my turn to bring in lunch for the team tomorrow, and I anticipate the preparation to be
quite labor intensive.”
“So you’ll cook for her, but not for me, is that it?”
I sighed. I had to make some sort of peace offering if I was to get her to shut up
and leave.
“I’ll leave a bowl out for you when I’m done.” The way her eyes bulged in rage
made me realize my offering hadn’t been accepted.
“A bowl? Of that shellfish shit?” She knew it was the only soup in my repertoire.
“Don’t tell me my sheets will smell like chowder tonight just because it’s Pam’s favorite.”
“It’s not a chowder, it’s a bisque! And that’s not her name!” I cycled through my
breathing exercises, but they helped about as much as regular strength tylenol for a
gunshot wound to the head. Still, they left me composed enough to continue with words
instead of something more severe. “Anyhow, it’s not for her. It’s for her fiance. See? I’m
not courting her. She’s on her way to being happily married… Just like us.”
We shared a laugh together, our first in years. But it hadn’t been enough. When it
died down, she was still standing there. One more olive branch ought to do it.
“I’ve decided to hear Michael’s offer.” I spat the words out, repulsed by their
taste. “But I want a face to face. Do you think you could set something up for after work
tomorrow?”
“Of course!” Her demeanor shifted to bubbly and bright. I wondered how much of
that was the money my book would fetch, and how much was the fact that she had an
excuse to call Michael. “I knew you’d come to your senses.”
“And I knew I could get you to leave by saying that,” I mumbled as she turned
and headed for the bedroom.
“What was that, Rick?” She paused at the doorway.
“Nothing, my sweet. Give Michael my best.”
The reward of her closed door was finally mine.
It took a 25 minute shower and three separate latherings to remove the bisque’s
perfume from my skin, and even then I half figured I’d just gone noseblind. The
exhaustive process of shelling, seasoning, and simmering had left me too depleted to
usher in Robert’s Rule, so I blew up my air mattress and walked to my desk to switch off
my lamp. But before I could, I saw Dorian and remembered how much fun we’d had. I
decided to load up my account to watch “Vol. 1” once more before drifting off to sleep,
as a bedtime story of sorts. What I found was something magical.
Since I’d last watched the video, others had been watching too. Millions of
others, according to the view counter in the bottom left corner. Seeing the number climb
before my eyes was a high that I assumed could never be matched. That was until I
started reading the comments.
Celebrated by stoners, retweeted by Leno, condemned by Jesús. Finally, my art
was getting the attention it deserved. Any hope I’d had of drifting off to sleep had
drowned in a flood of adrenaline that left me with two urges. First, I needed to show
Sam, and second, I needed a “Vol. 2.”
“So how is he today?” Having successfully secured the bisque in the breakroom
the next morning, I figured it was time to earn some empathy points with Sam.
“Gavin? He’s hanging in. I called him this morning and he said he’s coming home
from the hospital tonight, but I told him to take a couple extra days off to rest.”
“You’ve got such a big heart,” I said, capitalizing on the moment by resting a
hand on her bicep.
“Yeah. You know…” Sam hesitated.
“What is it?”
“Remember I said I want us to be like family here?”
“Of course. I want that too.” I refrained from telling her that I wanted to be her
family in accordance with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
“Well I don’t know about you, but in my family, we look after one another. If
someone’s hurt, we help out. And we check up on them. We don’t film them and post it
online to humiliate them.”
I had been expecting to surprise her with the video, and for that surprise to be a
pleasant one. In my mind I’d pictured her embracing me with a sensual hug. Hell, she’d
given Oskar one on Monday. It wasn’t so much of a stretch, was it? But not only had
she already seen the video, she hated it. I looked at Dorian on my desktop in disbelief.
“Don’t worry.” The voice returned. “Everything will fall into place.”
“Well I’m sorry if I came off as inconsiderate,” I said. “It won’t happen again. But I
have been thinking about our Gavin a lot. In fact, I was watching over him all night.”
Watching him over and over on my CYS channel to be precise.
“Aww.” Sam’s eyes softened. “I wish I’d been there with you, but I went home to
have dinner with Ray. You’re a good guy, Ricky. I’m sorry I doubted you. It’s just been
an emotional couple of days.” She breathed deeply, taking in my scent just as I’d done
to her two days prior, or so I thought. Her nose squinched. “Is that seafood chowder?”
“It’s bisque, baby.” I leaned in, hoping my culinary prowess would finally earn me
that hug. Instead, she took out her phone.
“I’ve gotta call Ray.”
I spent the working morning vacillating between correcting documents and
watching my “Vol. 1” views multiply. As with the previous day, Dorian’s presence made
my time more pleasant. But it also reminded me that I was a star now, and deserved to
be treated as such. I had already spent years of my life plodding along in anonymity
while my brilliant art sat ignored on the shelf, and what had it gotten me? Fired, for one.
Anger management had given me the tools to recognize that inviting my boss to
fuck his own asshole was a bad idea, and that breaking his nose with my fist was a
worse one. But to be fair, the man had just called that imbecile Michael “the funniest
man alive.” Anyhow, the past was the past, and reading that passage from my first book
had reminded me that I didn’t care to relive it. With that in mind, the next time I heard a
digital bell ringing, I made all of the necessary edits to the document, with one
unsolicited but important amendment. After eliminating the last comma splice, I wrote
three new words. Caught you slipping. I closed out the document and waited for my
next assignment.
“It’ll be fun, like a cookout!” That’s how Sam had sold it to us. The fact that we
were having lunch on a folding table in the middle of a parking lot. In November. With a
real feel temperature of 31 after wind chill. My plot to keep Ray and his allergies away
had been foiled. She assured us that he had a king sized bag of m&amp;m’s to tide him over,
and that he could still attend as long as we ate outside and he sat upwind. The protest
smoldering inside me was quickly doused when she said “it’s what we do for family.”
“Actually, this isn’t really cookout food,” Oskar said.
“I don’t mind,” Angela said. “Oh by the way, does anyone have any tupperware?
I’d like to bring some home for Prince Sparkles.”
Before I heard any reply, Ray arrived. He started speaking to me first like always.
“Hey, man.” He nodded, then saw Dorian sitting on my lap. “What’s with the retro
camcorder?”
“This isn’t just a camcorder. It’s Dorian,” I corrected.
“Okay, cool.” He pecked Sam on the cheek and leaned in as if to whisper
something in her ear, but he didn’t bother to lower his volume. “What’s up with that
weirdo?”
“Nothing weird here, brother. Just brought this to get a home video of our
cookout,” I said, locking eyes with Sam. “That’s what families do.”
“That’s a great idea, Ricky!” Sam flashed me her most photogenic smile. “Here,
get some footage of me.”
“Okay.” I lifted Dorian up, and let my finger hover over the record button, but
refrained from pressing it. I opened the side screen and stared at the tiny version of her.
“You look great!”
“Oskar next,” Sam said gleefully.
“Actually, I prefer not to be filmed while I’m eating,” he said. I honored his wish,
though he didn’t know it, seeing as Dorian was now pointed directly at him.
“How about you, Ray?” I asked. “Got any good party tricks for the camera?” I
knew a vain meathead like him wouldn’t be able to pass up the opportunity to showboat.
He’d be a perfect subject for “Vol. 2.”
He grabbed his bag of m&amp;m’s and tore a corner off, then tossed it onto the
foldout table right between Angela’s bowl of bisque and my own.
“I can catch that whole bag in my mouth without dropping one. You can all fire
‘em at me at once for all I care.”
“Now.” The voice spoke. I aimed the camera at Ray and pressed record.
Oskar, Sam, and Angel fired candy at Ray like a 21 gun salute. He leapt up for
some, and bent down for others, but he was a man of his word. He hadn’t dropped one.
“That all you got?” He smirked, then darted left to swallow an errant toss from
Oskar. “Ricky, start throwing. And don’t worry, I can catch underhand.”
I kept my eyes on Dorian to line up the shot, but groped the picnic table with my
left hand until I had what I wanted. Through the side screen I watched Sam toss a red
one, Oskar toss a blue one, me toss a pink one. Pop. Pop. Pop. Not one hit the ground.
The same couldn’t be said for Ray.
His throat swelled around the shrimp like a time lapse video of a tree enveloping
a skeleton. His knees wobbled as he grabbed his neck violently. It was as if he had
himself in a chokehold. The one man wrestling match continued as he crashed forward,
the plastic table ensnaring him as it buckled in two. Bowls of bisque exploded on the
skyline like fireworks as Sam rushed over to Ray and started giving him CPR.
Emotions were running high, and there would be heated debate among the staff
of Otto Correct. But after video review, I can proudly and unequivocally say that I waited
until after the shrimp spurted from Ray’s mouth to lean in and say “caught you slipping!”
“What the hell do you want, Ricky?” True, it wasn’t the phone greeting I’d hoped
for, but factoring in Sam’s ire as she’d rushed Ray off to the hospital, I took any greeting
at all as a humble win. Just three hours ago, she had gone so far as to scream at me to
“get that fucking camera out of his face!” She was lucky I was the forgiving type, though
it remained to be seen whether or not Dorian shared my generosity of spirit.
“Just checking in,” I said as solemnly as I could muster. “On my family.” She
offered a theatrical sigh in response. “How’s Ray?”
“Shitty, Ricky. He’s half scared to death, and I’m about three quarters so. He
fucked his leg up pretty badly in the fall. I’ve got him in a wheelchair to be safe. But the
CPR worked, and so did his EpiPen. He’ll be okay.”
“Well that’s a relief.” And I meant it. Throughout our talk, I’d been monitoring the
views on “Vol. 2,” and a dead Ray would certainly put a crimp in its viral viability. Keep
him alive. Keep him weak, and scared, and humiliated, and see how long it took for
Sam to pack her bags and upgrade to a real man. See how long it took for her to find
herself a star.
“How are things at the office?” She’d settled down enough to change the subject.
That had to be a good sign.
“Not bad. Though they’d be better if we had our fearless leader.”
“Hah, yeah. Here’s hoping tomorrow I can break my streak of rushing someone
off to the ER. Hey, speaking of work, I got a call earlier from Google. They said we’re
doing great for the most part, but that one of our documents had a suspicious addition.
Beyond correcting spelling and grammar. You know anything about that, Ricky?”
“Can’t say that I do.” Because if I did, she’d fire me.
At that moment I felt drawn to Dorian, like he was trying to tell me something.
“Get the girl to come,” he instructed me.
“Hey, I’ve been thinking. I feel awful about earlier. I want to make it up to you and
Ray. I’m about to go meet some bigwigs from The Office. They’re interested in Mindless
Mike.”
“Mindless who?”
My fists tightened. I masked my breathing exercises with terse laughter.
“Mindless Mike Moves On. My book. Or Eight hundred sixty two pages of literary
glory, as I like to call it. Anywho, you two should tag along. It’ll be great!”
“Look, Ricky, that’s a nice offer, but it’s not necessary. Besides, Ray needs his
rest.”
“We need the girl,” Dorian said. “It won’t work without the girl.”
“At least ask him what he wants to do. I insist!” Fearing I’d pushed too hard, I
softened my approach. “Please? Michael will be there.”
“Michael? Oh wow. Well, I guess I can ask.”
She put the phone down, but I could make out enough of his muffled good cheer
to know it had worked.
“Okay, we’re in! Thanks, Ricky, this has really lifted Ray’s spirits. He just loves
Michael. We both do.”
“Don’t mention it.”
The steam whistle cartoon appeared on my desktop signifying the end of the day.
I put the finishing touches on my last open document, smiling with the certainty that
even though I had just done my best work yet, there was something even greater on the
horizon.
We arrived at the studio like a family of four. Dorian was cradled in my arms like
my baby, and Sam pushed Ray around like a spoiled child who demanded the stroller
even though he’d outgrown it. When we approached the security gate, two big guys
dressed in all black from shoes to sunglasses stepped forward.
“Excuse me, can I help you folks?” The big guy on the left asked.
“I’m here to see Michael,” I said.
The guy on the right snickered.
“Michael?”
“You heard me. I’m a writer.”
“And what’s your name, sir?” Lefty asked.
“Ricky! And I’m very busy, so I’d appreciate it if you just-” I stepped forward, but
Righty put a hand up to stop me.
“Hold on, sir. I’m sorry, but I’ve got the list of screenwriters right here, and I don’t
see anyone named Ricky.”
“I’m not a screenwriter, you dolt! I’m an author! I wrote the books.”
“Books?” Lefty asked.
“What, like fan fiction?” Righty chimed in.
“No. Nothing like fan fiction. I’m a star. Hell, Leno retweeted me.” My fingers were
burning to press Dorian’s record button. My breathing was shallow, and my brow was
drenched. Frustration had me on the brink of a panic attack, until fortuitously, I saw him
walking toward us.
“Michael!” I shouted.
“Hey, Steve,” Lefty said. “This guy Ricky here says he’s a writer. You know
anything about that?”
Michael grinned and told the security guard it was just a big misunderstanding,
and that he’d take care of it. He turned to us and smiled.
“Nice to meet you,” he said, and reached his hand out to shake mine.
I let out a flustered laugh.
“Good one, Michael.”
He addressed the whole group, leaning in and putting his hand on my shoulder
like he was talking to simpletons.
“Hey guys. You must be the special visitors that Linda told me about. Your tour
isn’t until later, but I’ll tell you what, we can all take a picture together right now. Would
you like that?”
“Oh, yeah!” Ray said, clapping. His childlike enthusiasm did nothing to dispel the
misconception that we had taken a short bus to get there.
“Now,” Dorian said.
“How about a video?” I asked, holding Dorian up for all to see.
“Even better,” Michael said with a smile. He found a wide stretch of sidewalk in
front of a statue of himself, and started posing.
“You first, Sam.” I hit record and focused Dorian on Michael. “I’ll take care of
Ray.”
“Okay, sure.” I kept filming Michael as she handed me Ray’s wheelchair. The
driveway leading up to the security gate had a considerable incline, and would make for
a great vantage point for the video. I kept Dorian steady in my right hand as I walked
backward and rolled Ray’s wheelchair with my left. By the time I had gotten to the top of
the hill, Sam was in place directly to Michael’s left.
“Looking good,” I called down to them. “Alright, now say ‘that’s what she said!’”
I oriented Ray’s wheelchair to Michael’s right side and let go. Ray careened
down the hill, right on target. Just as I’d planned, Mindless Mike leapt toward Sam.
“Hey, that’s my breast!” Sam shouted.
“That’s what she said?” Michael removed his hand from Sam’s chest. The statue
of Michael had broken Ray’s fall, and broken itself in the process. Ray had made a 90
degree turn, and was fuming at Michael.
“You just groped my fiancee, buddy.”
“I’m so sorry, it was an honest mistake. I was trying to get out of the way, and I
lost my balance.”
“So you thought you’d find it on her tits?” Ray stood up from his chair, but quickly
started screaming in agony. Sam helped guide him back to his seat. “This is
unacceptable, man. It’s assault. We’re gonna sue!”
I accompanied Dorian down the hill, zoomed in on the tears welling underneath
Michael’s eyes, and said “caught you slipping!”
True, it wasn’t on my original terms, but the pending legal matter had gotten me a
sit down with the showrunners. I had told them that Ray was an emotional guy, but not a
smart one, and that he could be played like a gong. And Sam? She had a generous
heart. She could be reasoned with. I explained to them that I, on the other hand, was
the force to be reckoned with. I had the mind, and I had the tape.
“So Ricky, tell me,” the producer said. “What will it take to make all of this go
away?”
“Michael,” I said. “He goes away, and this does too.”
“But Michael’s the show!” The director said, fuming. “Without him there is no
Office.”
“I wholeheartedly disagree,” I said. “In fact, right now I’m already working on an
Office without Michael. It’s called Robert’s Rule, and I’ll sell you the rights… for the right
price. But if we do this, we do it my way. None of the butchery of my brilliance you idiots
pass off as edits.”
“Fuck this guy,” the director said to the producer. “He’s delusional. I can’t make a
show without edits. And what the hell is Robert’s Rule anyway?”
“Robert California, your new boss.”
“Robert California? That sounds preposterous,” the director said.
“Maybe we could just go a different way,” the producer said. “You know, get Will
Ferrell or something.”
I laughed derisively. “Good luck getting that to last.”
“We just need to keep that video hidden,” the PR rep said. “Then Michael can go
quietly, and the show can continue.”
“Could we make a storyline work for that?” The producer asked.
“Well, things have been heating up with him and Holly,” The director said. “They
could move to Colorado to be with her family.”
“Not ideal, but it’ll have to do,” the producer replied.
“So, if we write Michael out, and we pay you for this Robert California character,
you’ll keep that video out of sight?” The PR rep asked.
“I swear on my wife’s life,” I replied.
“It’s settled then,” the producer said. She picked up a landline on the table and
called her secretary. “Linda, bring in the NDA.”
“What the fuck is this?” I had been enjoying the serenity of watching my views
grow with Dorian, when Meredith barged into the office. She was waving her phone in
my face, enraged. The violent flailing of her arms made immediate identification difficult,
but based on the audio, I could tell she’d been watching “Vol. 3.”
“You vindictive little fuck muffin!” She shouted. “You ruined him. And for what? To
hurt me? You knew I’d always loved him, didn’t you?” To that point I had refused to take
my eyes off my channel views. A hard slap on the cheek got my attention. “Huh? You
knew it. You fucking knew it, you miserable piece of cochroach shit.”
“You’ve got it all wrong, Meredith. You’re being irrational. I can explain…” She
was generous in the time she gave me to continue, but there was nothing to say. She
had already arrived at the truth of the matter.
“You just spurned the only person who ever believed in you.” I opened my mouth,
thought of Michael, closed it. “Get out!” She shouted.
“But this is my-” I felt that if I shouted loud enough, it would pass for conviction,
even if I couldn’t finish a thought.
“Get…” she picked up my prized fountain pens: black, red, and blue. “…Out!” She
fired them at me, one after the other. The black struck me in the clavicle, the red across
the heart, the blue in the belly.
“Be careful with my things.”
“You care more about your things than you do people. Your calfskin notebook…”
She launched it at my calfskin. “…Your petulant little books…” She hurled Mindless Mike
at the mind that had birthed it. “…Your precious video camera!”
“Put Dorian down!” I roared. I could tell I had rattled her, but she kept raging.
“Dorian? Sounds more like a boyfriend then a camera.” She raised him to her line
of vision and acted out a mocking charade of filming. Her finger lowered and brushed up
against the record button.
“Ok, I’ll leave!” I did my breathing exercises for what would turn out to be the last
time. “Just put him down, and I’ll go. I promise.”
“Alright then.” She placed Dorian back on my desk with care, then reached into
her back pocket and handed me a garbage bag for my belongings.
When I had finished packing, I slung the bag over my shoulder as if I were some
hobo and not an internet superstar. Still, holding Dorian I felt some semblance of
dignity. As I walked out of the apartment I had shared with Meredith, a wave of freedom
rushed over me. By now Ray and Sam were probably quarreling, and tomorrow I’d
finally be free to pursue her openly and unapologetically. Still, I felt a pang of regret as I
gazed at the rotten top step for what might be the last time. Together, Dorian and I had
seen so much potential in it. The thought of it weighed heavy on my shoulders along
with my possessions as I trod down the stairs. When I got to the bottom, I looked back
wistfully. I knew something needed to be said, needed to be done, but I had no words. I
had no plan. Fortunately, I had Dorian.
“She wants a break,” he said. “Let’s give her one.”
I took my calfskin journal out of the trash bag and propped it at an angle between
the bottom step and the entryway floor. Taking great care, I propped Dorian on top and
looked through his lens. I could see the rotten top step with picture perfect clarity. I
stepped outside with the rest of my things, but before I left, I leaned down to Dorian and
pressed record.
Just as my things had settled onto a pile on my motel bed, I was starting to settle
in after the eventful night. I had watched unphased as Mindless Mike Moves On
bounced off the twin sized mattress and onto the carpet below. Maybe it was just a little
book. After all, in spite of its girth, it had never lifted me to the heights that Dorian had.
“You did great back there,” Dorian congratulated me. “The bitch is finally dead.
Now you can move on.”
I took a seat at the motel desk where Dorian rested and leaned back, flexing my
elbows above my head in relaxation. It was over. Done. I’d never again have to suffer
through another conversation with-
“Meredith?” My cell phone started vibrating on the desk next to Dorian, and her
name was written across the screen. I picked up.
“Ricky,” the way she said my name told me everything. She had washed her
sleeping pills down with a bottle of pinot noir, and yet she was somehow alert enough to
be hysterical. “The cops are here! What the hell did you do?” Her sobbing became
uncontrollable.
“I don’t know,” I answered honestly, assuming that what I’d done was kill her.
“Your boss, P-P-Pam…”
“That’s not her fucking name!”
“She’s d-d-dead!”
I felt as though someone had sliced my scalp off and poured acid on my naked
brain. Sam, dead? It was impossible. Unless…
“You did this, you malicious succubus! You wanted revenge!”
“No, Ricky, I didn’t! I swear!”
“She’s telling the truth, you know.” It was Dorian. I hung up.
“What the hell are you talking about?” I turned to him. “This isn’t funny!”
“Do you hear me laughing?” Dorian asked. My laptop flipped open of its own
volition. It called up a video on the CYS channel named “Vol. 4” without any intervention
on my part.
It started with an empty staircase, then the back of a woman appeared. Sam’s
back to be precise. My heart sunk as her feet ascended the stairs. I felt relieved when
she successfully navigated the top step and knocked on the apartment door, but less so
when there was no reply. Then, a man’s voice, off screen.
“She won’t answer,” A man with my voice said words I didn’t remember.
Onscreen, I watched the actor playing myself climb up to Sam’s level. “By now, she’s
probably ingested so many depressants that a doctor would call her comatose.” When
the man that looked like me reached the top of the stairs, he held Sam’s hands in his
own, and spoke to her softly. “We had a fight.”
“Oh. I’m sorry to hear that, Ricky. But as I’m sure you’ve guessed, I didn’t come
here to talk to your wife. Can we go inside?”
“A lot of things have changed since we last spoke, Sam.” The man inserted
himself between Sam and the apartment door. “I no longer live here, and she’s no
longer my wife.”
Sam looked startled at the man’s admissions.
“Oh no. I’m sorry, I should have called before I came. I just… there’s something I
wanted to talk to you about, but I can tell you’re upset. It can wait. I’ll be going now.”
She turned to leave, but the man grabbed her by the wrist.
“No.” She flinched and turned around. “You came all this way. Going through all
that trouble, you must have something important to say.”
“I, uh…”
“Spit it out, my dear! I’m single now, unfettered. There’s no need for either of us
to keep secrets anymore.” The man that looked like me looked maniacal.
“Well okay. I hate to pile on, Ricky, but I came to talk to you about your behavior.
I’m worried about you. The way you taped Gavin and didn’t help him, that was one
thing, okay? But I’m beginning to think that feeding Ray that shrimp wasn’t an accident.”
“What gave you that idea?” The camera caught a sinister glimmer not unlike a
flickering flame in the man’s eyes.
“You used that stupid catchphrase again, and you posted the video, even though
I said that’s not what family does! And then that whole Michael thing?”
“Michael got what he had coming.”
“See? That’s exactly what I’m talking about, Ricky. Michael isn’t real.”
“Of course he is. He grabbed your breast. I have video proof!”
“You have proof of a frame job on an actor, nothing more. You see that?” She
raised her phone and showed the man a picture. It looked exactly like Michael, but the
name underneath his photo was different. “What does that say? C’mon, Ricky, tell me!”
“Steve…” The man looked down at his feet like a child who wanted to cry.
“Steve what, Ricky? Steve what?”
“Steve… Carell.”
“You see, Ricky? Michael isn’t a real person. He’s a made up character.”
“That’s not true!” The man shouted. “That’s from Wikipedia. Anyone can go in
and change that shit.”
“But it is true, Ricky, and you know it. Look, that’s not the only thing that has me
worried. You had such a good start at Otto Correct. But I got another call from Google
tonight. They said you didn’t make any corrections to your documents this afternoon.
You just kept writing ‘caught you slipping’ over and over. I mean, buddy, I love having
you on the team, but that’s some Jack Torrance shit!”
“So what do you propose?” The man asked with a calmness neither Sam nor I
believed.
“I want you to get help, Ricky. Professional help. I can find you a spot to get
some rest and, you know, get your head right.”
“And that’s the only option, Sam?”
“Yeah, Ricky. It’s either that or I’ll have to fire you. I can’t afford to lose Google.”
“You can’t fire me,” the man chuckled at the thought. “I’ll expose you.”
“No, you can’t do that. You signed an NDA.”
He howled at that one.
“I signed one for Michael too. I’m sure they can find an open cell for you right
next to his.”
“This has gone too far,” she said. “You’ve got better options than that. Come with
me, we’ll find you a safe place.” She gestured him forward with an open palm and
flicking fingers.
“I’ve got a better option. Let’s be together.” The man lurched forward.
“No!” She pushed him back. “I’m with Ray. Look, I’m coming to you because
you’re an old friend. But there’s nothing more to it, and there never will be. Give it up,
Ricky. No matter how many books you write about me, I’ll never, ever love you.”
“Then perhaps I should focus on someone who will.” The man stared directly into
Dorian’s lens, grabbed Sam by the hips, and pushed.
I covered my eyes with my palms, but Sam’s screams and the loud echoing
thuds of her body hitting each step were far more haunting than any video footage could
ever be.
“Caught you slipping,”the man said after the last thud.
I collapsed out of the chair, my tears slapping against the motel carpet. For a
time I kept my head in my hands, until I realized they were the same hands that had
pushed the life out Sam. Flicked her down like a line of dominoes. Whatever insulting
labels Meredith had thrown at me had been insufficient.
“You monster!” I shouted at Dorian as I smacked him from the desk and onto the
floor. I called up the settings for “Vol. 4” and prepared to delete it.
“I wouldn’t do that if I was you,” Dorian said from his spot on the floor.
“I have to,” I said. “This has gone too far!”
“That’s what she said,” he said.
I examined him with horror as I realized that in his fall from the desk, his record
button had turned on. I stood up and sprinted as far away from him as I could as fast as
I could. I had forgotten about the eight hundred and sixty two pages of Mindless Mike
Moves On that lay on the floor in front of me. But try as I might, having run from him for
years, it seemed old Mike hadn’t forgotten about me.</p>
